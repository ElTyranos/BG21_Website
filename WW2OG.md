# World War 2 : Open Games

Re-enact WW2 over 3 theatres : Africa, Eastern and Western Europe.
Missions oppose allies factions (USA, UK, Russia) to axis factions (Japan, Germany) and focus on simple infantry combat to more complex operations combining tanks and planes.

Master word is authenticity, therefore, no moddern functionnalities and a very few number of radios.

## When do we play ?
We usually play on thursdays at **9PM** Paris time.  
Upcoming games are announced on Discord. A planning is available and mission registration is announced via post a few days prior to the game.  


**Before 8PM :** Don't forget to check your mod synchronisations, some updates can be done late - try your setup on the test server. That's the best way to have technical assistance in time.  
**8:30 PM** Begin connecting to teamspeak / game server. There's usually a team deathmatch mission running as warm-up.
**9:05 PM :** 1st mission start  
The game will start at 9:05 PM. If you were late and not updated, we're sorry for you, you'll be able to catch up at the break between the two games, and you will come and test earlier next times :).
